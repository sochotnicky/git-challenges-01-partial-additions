Task
====

Your task is to commit changes in this repository. To make things more
interesting, you have to create 2 commits - one for each method that was added
to the main.py


Solution
========
This type of task can be best finished using "git add -p". This will start
"addition mode" where git will start asking questions about which changed chunks
you want to add to index for future committing. 

You can split the chunks into smaller pieces by typing "s". This is helpful in
instances like this one where git offers you a big chunk that includes both
pieces you want to add to the next commit and pieces you want to leave for
later.

So you can split the chunk, then say "y" to add square method into index.
Followed by "q" to end staging chunks. And git commit to commit the square
method. You can then run git commit -a to commit rest of the changes
